Description coming soon.

## Demo

https://alecrios.github.io/image-zoom-js/

&nbsp;

## Development

This project is still under development and not production-ready. It is written in ES2015, so it needs to be compiled with something like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for better browser support.

&nbsp;

## Usage

1. Include `image-zoom.css`.
``` html
<link href="css/image-zoom.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

2. Include `image-zoom.js`.
``` html
<script src="js/image-zoom.js"></script>
```

3. Add the `data-zoom-image` attribute to an `<img>`.
``` html
<img src="img/fruit.jpg" data-zoom-image>
```
